## 📘 Project Overview
Deforestation is one of the major causes of global warming and climate imbalance.  
The goal of this project is to use **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Computer Vision (CV)** techniques to detect deforestation areas from satellite images.  
By identifying and classifying land cover changes, this project supports **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** like:
- 🌿 **SDG 13:** Climate Action  
- 🌲 **SDG 15:** Life on Land

## 🎯 Objectives
1. To collect and preprocess satellite image data of forest areas.  
2. To analyze visual patterns indicating deforestation.  
3. To develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can detect deforested regions.  
4. To create a sustainable AI solution that can monitor environmental changes effectively.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Deforestation is a major environmental issue causing biodiversity loss and global climate change.  
Traditional monitoring techniques are time-consuming and require manual effort.  
This project leverages AI to **automate deforestation detection** using satellite image data.
